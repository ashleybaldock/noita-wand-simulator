* use a single "deck" array, and just move pointers to indicate where the
  discard-hand and hand-deck boundaries are
  * might be complicated by divide by spells, which can discard directly from deck
* expose function to click, not just cast until refresh
* shuffle (after each refresh)
* more recursive approach to drawing/applying
  * for example, double spell would draw/apply twice
